# File Encryption/Decryption Tool

This is a simple file encryption and decryption tool written in C. It uses XOR encryption to securely encode and decode files.

## Description

This project is a simple command-line application designed to facilitate the encryption and decryption of files. Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt specific text files by providing the necessary input and output file paths. The tool serves as an introductory example of file handling and encryption concepts in C.

## Features

- Encrypt a file using XOR encryption
- Decrypt a file using XOR decryption (same operation)

## Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)

### Build with `Makefile`

To build the project, run:

```bash
make
